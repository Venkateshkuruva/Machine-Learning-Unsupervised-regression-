# Machine-Learning-Unsupervised-regression-

📁 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Simple Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict an employee’s salary based on their years of experience.

🚀 Key Features
Loads and preprocesses the dataset using pandas.

Splits the data into training and test sets.

Implements a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn.

Visualizes the regression results with matplotlib.

Evaluates model performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn


📁 Dataset
Source: Salary_Data.csv

Features:

YearsExperience

Salary



📈 Results
A best-fit regression line is drawn over the training and test data.

Model predicts salaries with reasonable accuracy for unseen data.

R² score and MSE are used to measure model performance.
